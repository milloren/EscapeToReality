Fake faces hiding everywhere <br>
Made up, makeup, made up stares<br>
To hide their stolen air<br>
Don't look too close, don't you dare<br>
Stupid seems to be in the air<br>
In the air, everywhere<br>
Blameless I'll shatter through the glare<br>
Make it, take it, they won't share<br>
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own<br>
(On my own)<br>
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne<br>
(On my throne)<br>
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own<br>
(On my own)<br>

I can't blame them, I just got to get to my throne<br>
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs<br>
I read all the lyrics, so I can sing along<br>
I am the latest colors, I stand above my throne<br>
Waiting for an invite to never come along<br>
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs<br>
I read all the lyrics, so I can sing along<br>
I am the latest colors, I hate the newest songs<br>
I can't stand the lyrics, I'd never sing along<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
I'll never sing along<br>

Trade places, staggered truth or dare<br>
Only ask it if you care<br>
Trace back to all the millionaires<br>
Snake oil traiders, no one shares<br>
Soulless and stealing what they dare<br>
Hold your deck to your chest<br>
Faceless, nobody is your friend<br>
Make it, take it, they won't share<br>
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own<br>
(On my own)<br>
I can't blame them, I'll just maim them on my throne<br>
(On my throne)<br>
I can't fake it, I'll just make it on my own<br>
(On my own)<br>
I can't blame them, I just got to get to my throne<br>
I am the latest colors, I sing the newest songs<br>
I read all the lyrics, so I can sing along<br>
I am the latest colors, I hate the newest songs<br>
I can't stand the lyrics, I'd never sing along<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
I'll never sing along<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
(On my own)<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
(On my throne)<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
(On my own)<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
La-la-la-la-la-la-la<br>
