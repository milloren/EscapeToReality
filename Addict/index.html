'Til death do us part but we're already past that phase<br>
This is a brand new start and I think I deserve some praise<br>
For the way that I am<br>
Despite having overdosed and ending up comatose<br>
I don't give a damn<br>
I've let my emotions go, fuck being a sober hoe<br>
This is the mantra, this is my life<br>
You're playing with now 'til the end of the night<br>
Surrounded by fire, the passion ignites<br>
A hit of that Heaven and Hell, a hell of a high<br>
</p>
<p style="font-size: 140%">

I'm addicted to the madness, this hotel is my Atlantis<br>
We're forever gonna have a fucking reason to sin<br>
Let me leave my soul to burn and I'll be breathing it in<br>
I'm addicted to the feeling, getting higher than the ceiling<br>
And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end<br>
Just concede and give in to your inner demons again<br>

</p>


<p style="font-size: 140%">
Yeah, you fell in love but you fell deeper in this pit<br>
While death rains from above<br>
So count your blessings 'cause this is it<br>
You’re not letting it go<br>
So what if I misbehave? It's what everybody craves<br>
You already know<br>
So, come if you're feeling brave and fancy yourself a mate<br>
You want it, I got it, see what you like?<br>
We could have it all by the end of the night<br>
Your money and power, my sinful delight<br>
A hit of that Heaven and Hell, a hell of a high<br>

I'm addicted to the madness, this hotel is my Atlantis<br>
We're forever gonna have a fucking reason to sin<br>
Let me leave my soul to burn and I'll be breathing it in<br>
I'm addicted to the feeling, getting higher than the ceiling<br>
And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end<br>
Just concede and give in to your inner demons again<br>
Just concede and give in to your inner demons again<br>
</p>


<p style="font-size: 140%">
I'm addicted to the feeling<br>
Getting higher than the ceiling<br>
And we're never gonna want this fucking feeling to end<br>
Just concede and give in to your inner demons again<br>
