Hey girl, open the walls<br>
Play with your dolls<br>
We'll be a perfect family<br>
When you walk away is when we really play<br>
You don't hear me when I say<br>
"Mom, please wake up<br>
Dad's with a slut<br>
And your son is smoking cannabis"<br>
</p>


<p style="font-size: 140%">
No one ever listens<br>
This wallpaper glistens<br>
Don't let them see what goes down in the kitchen<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
Places, places<br>
Get in your places<br>
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces<br>
Everyone thinks that we're perfect<br>
Please don't let them look through the curtains<br>
Picture, picture, smile for the picture<br>
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?<br>
Everyone thinks that we're perfect<br>
Please don't let them look through the curtains<br>


D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E<br>
I see things that nobody else sees<br>
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E, I see things that nobody else sees<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
Hey girl, look at my mom<br>
She's got it going on<br>
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry<br>
When you turn your back<br>
She pulls out a flask<br>
And forgets his infidelity<br>
Uh oh, she's coming to the attic, plastic<br>
Go back to being plastic<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
No one ever listens<br>
This wallpaper glistens<br>
One day they'll see what goes down in the kitchen<br>


Places, places<br>
Get in your places<br>
Throw on your dress and put on your doll faces<br>
Everyone thinks that we're perfect<br>
Please don't let them look through the curtains<br>
Picture, picture, smile for the picture<br>
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?<br>
Everyone thinks that we're perfect<br>
Please don't let them look through the curtains<br>




D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E<br>
I see things that nobody else sees<br>
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E, I see things that nobody else sees<br>
</p>
