<p style="font-size: 140%"><b>
I got my driver's license last week<br>
Just like we always talked about<br>
'cause you were so excited for me<br>
To finally drive up to your house<br>
But today I drove through the suburbs<br>
Crying 'cause you weren't around<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
And you're probably with that blonde girl<br>
Who always made me doubt<br>
She's so much older than me<br>
She's everything I'm insecure about<br>
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs<br>
'cause how could I ever love someone else?<br>


And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one<br>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br>
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br>
'cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
And all my friends are tired<br>
Of hearing how much I miss you but<br>
I kinda feel sorry for them<br>
'cause they'll never know you the way that I do<br>
Yeah, today I drove through the suburbs<br>
And pictured I was driving home to you<br>

And I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one<br>
Oh, and I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br>
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br>
'cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
Red lights<br>
Stop signs<br>
I still see your face<br>
In the white cars<br>
Front yards<br>
Can't drive past the places<br>
We used to<br>
Go to<br>
'cause I still fucking love you, babe<br>

Sidewalks<br>
We crossed<br>
I still hear your voice<br>
In the traffic<br>
We're laughing<br>
Over all the noise<br>
God, I'm so blue<br>
Know we're through<br>
But I still fucking love you, babe<br>
</p>

<p style="font-size: 140%">
I know we weren't perfect but I've never felt this way for no one<br>
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone<br>
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me<br>
'cause you said forever now I drive alone past your street<br>
Yeah, you said forever now I drive alone past your street<br>
